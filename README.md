# learn-english
This is a personal english vocabulary used to learn new words. 

How it works: 
1. Creates a .txt file if no one exist, to store the dictionary
2. Can add or change meanings

What will be added: 
- generates a (user-specified) number of english words to guess and gives you the score for how many of them were correctly guessed. 
- deletes a word in the dictionary, if no word correspond to the present ones in the dictionary it outputs the list of words that are mostly similar to the queried one (using hamming distance)
